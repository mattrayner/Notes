## Setting up shortcuts ##
##########################

# Sortcuts allow you to run quick commands such as
# .. (cd ..)
# or custom commands such as:
# . . (go to working directory)
# . dtp (go to desktop
# sscf (Save shortcut config files)



## HOW TO SET IT UP

# Pull the Notes repo from GIT
# open up bashrc.backup & bash_profile.backup

# Use common sense to pull the bits you need and place
# them into ~/.bashrc and ~/bash_profile

# You may need to edit the contents of these two to make
# them user specific



## HOW TO ADD SHORTCUTS

# From within the Notes repo folder open shortcuts.sh
# append to the
#
# if [ $1 = "." ]then;
#     cd ~/bPlanHQ/
# elif [ $1 = "dtp" ]then;
#     cd ~/Desktop/
# fi
#
# Then you will be able to reference your new shortcuts
# right away!
# 
# $ . myshortcut



## WHAT ABOUT NEW COMMANDS

# So you want to add new commands?
#
# All you need to do is add a new alias to ~/.bashrc
# 
# myInDepthFunction() {
#     # Do something
#     cd /opt/folder
# }
# alias idf=myInDepthFunction
#
# The above will execute all of the code inide of myInDepthFunction
# when you type 'idf' into the shell
#
# $ idf
#
# For simpler commands you can write the command directly into alias
#
# alias simplecommand = "sh ~/Notes/somescript.sh"
#
# --- NOTE: If you want to pass arguments you need to do it the
#     function way ---
